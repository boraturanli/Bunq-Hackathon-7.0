# bunqShare — CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

bunqShare is a hackathon project for bunq Hackathon 7.0 (24-hour build, April 2026).

Photograph a receipt → AI parses line items → invite friends via link → each person selects what they had → everyone pays the host automatically through bunq.

Built as a mobile-responsive Next.js web app. No native mobile, no multi-currency. Needs minimal server-side session state (in-memory store is fine for demo).

## Core Flow

### Host flow
 1.⁠ ⁠Photograph or upload a receipt
 2.⁠ ⁠AI parses line items
 3.⁠ ⁠Open side panel → select people to split with (top 5 bunq friends + manual add by name & email)
 4.⁠ ⁠Tap "Send Links" → each person receives a unique invite link by email
 5.⁠ ⁠Host sees a live tracking screen showing who has paid and who hasn't
 6.⁠ ⁠Host receives a notification each time someone pays, with a summary of what they paid for

### Invitee flow (via unique link)
 1.⁠ ⁠Open link → see the full parsed receipt
 2.⁠ ⁠Tap items they had; tap again on a shared item to split it equally among everyone who also claimed it
 3.⁠ ⁠Running total updates live at the bottom
 4.⁠ ⁠Tap "Confirm & Pay" → bunq OAuth → payment transfers to host's account automatically
 5.⁠ ⁠If they had nothing → tap "I had nothing" → skip payment, close screen

## Tech Stack

•⁠  ⁠*Framework:* Next.js (App Router), TypeScript
•⁠  ⁠*Styling:* Tailwind CSS
•⁠  ⁠*State:* React ⁠ useReducer ⁠ for item-claim logic, ⁠ useState ⁠ elsewhere
•⁠  ⁠*Session store:* In-memory Map on the server (keyed by session ID); no external DB needed for demo
•⁠  ⁠*Vision model:* OpenAI GPT-4o via ⁠ /api/parse ⁠ server route
•⁠  ⁠*Image preprocessing:* Sharp (server-side sharpening + basic normalisation)
•⁠  ⁠*Payments:* bunq API via OAuth — invitees pay host via ⁠ payment ⁠ endpoint (not payment-request)
•⁠  ⁠*Deployment:* Vercel (or local for demo)

## Architecture


[Host: Camera / File Upload]
         ↓
[POST /api/parse — Sharp → GPT-4o → Receipt JSON]
         ↓
[Host: side panel — select top-5 bunq friends + manual add by name/email]
         ↓
[POST /api/session — create session, store receipt + invitees, return sessionId]
         ↓
[Server: email unique links  →  /split/[sessionId]/[inviteeId]  to each person]
         ↓
[Invitee: opens link → GET /api/session/[sessionId] → see receipt]
         ↓
[Invitee: selects items + shared splits → local state]
         ↓
[Invitee: "Confirm & Pay" → bunq OAuth → POST /api/session/[sessionId]/pay]
         ↓
[Server: execute bunq payment from invitee to host → mark invitee as paid]
         ↓
[Host tracking screen polls GET /api/session/[sessionId]/status]
         ↓
[Host sees live payment confirmations + per-person summaries]


Vision API calls are server-side. Item-claim logic is pure client state while the invitee is selecting. Session state lives server-side so all participants share the same receipt.

## Key Data Structures

### Parsed receipt (output of ⁠ /api/parse ⁠)
⁠ typescript
interface Receipt {
  merchant: string;
  date: string;           // ISO 8601
  currency: string;       // "EUR"
  items: LineItem[];
  subtotal: number;
  tax: number;
  tip: number;
  total: number;
}

interface LineItem {
  id: number;
  description: string;
  quantity: number;
  unit_price: number;
  line_total: number;
}
 ⁠

### Session (server-side, in-memory)
⁠ typescript
interface Session {
  id: string;                    // uuid
  receipt: Receipt;
  host: { bunqUserId: string; bunqIban: string; name: string };
  invitees: Invitee[];
  createdAt: number;             // Date.now()
}

interface Invitee {
  id: string;                    // uuid, used in invite link
  name: string;
  email: string;
  status: "pending" | "paid" | "skipped";
  claims: ItemClaim[];           // set when they submit
  amountPaid?: number;
  paidAt?: number;
}

interface ItemClaim {
  itemId: number;
  sharedWith: number;            // how many people claimed this item (including self); cost = line_total / sharedWith
}
 ⁠

### Person (side panel)
⁠ typescript
interface Person {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  bunqUserId?: string;           // present for top-5 friends fetched from bunq
  avatarColor: string;
  isTopFriend: boolean;
}
 ⁠

## API Routes

### ⁠ POST /api/parse ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Accepts: ⁠ multipart/form-data ⁠ with ⁠ image ⁠ field
•⁠  ⁠Preprocesses with Sharp, sends to GPT-4o with structured output
•⁠  ⁠Validates: ⁠ sum(line_totals) + tax + tip ≈ total ⁠ (±2% tolerance)
•⁠  ⁠Returns: ⁠ Receipt ⁠ JSON or ⁠ { error: string } ⁠
•⁠  ⁠On mismatch: still return data, include ⁠ { warning: "totals_mismatch" } ⁠

### ⁠ GET /api/friends ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Requires: host bunq OAuth token in session cookie
•⁠  ⁠Fetches recent payment counterparties from bunq transaction history
•⁠  ⁠Returns: top 5 by transaction count as ⁠ Person[] ⁠

### ⁠ POST /api/session ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Accepts: ⁠ { receipt: Receipt, invitees: { name: string, email: string }[], hostBunqToken: string } ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Creates session in server-side store, generates unique invitee IDs
•⁠  ⁠Sends invite emails with links ⁠ /split/[sessionId]/[inviteeId] ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Returns: ⁠ { sessionId: string } ⁠

### ⁠ GET /api/session/[sessionId] ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Public (no auth) — used by invitees to load the receipt
•⁠  ⁠Returns: ⁠ { receipt: Receipt, merchant: string, hostName: string } ⁠

### ⁠ POST /api/session/[sessionId]/pay ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Accepts: ⁠ { inviteeId: string, claims: ItemClaim[], bunqToken: string } ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Computes amount from claims, executes bunq ⁠ payment ⁠ from invitee → host IBAN
•⁠  ⁠Marks invitee as paid in session store
•⁠  ⁠Returns: ⁠ { success: boolean, amountPaid: number } ⁠

### ⁠ POST /api/session/[sessionId]/skip ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Accepts: ⁠ { inviteeId: string } ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Marks invitee as skipped (had nothing, owes nothing)
•⁠  ⁠Returns: ⁠ { success: boolean } ⁠

### ⁠ GET /api/session/[sessionId]/status ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Requires: host auth cookie
•⁠  ⁠Returns: ⁠ { invitees: { id, name, status, amountPaid, claims }[] } ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Polled by host tracking screen every 3 seconds

### ⁠ GET /api/bunq/callback ⁠
•⁠  ⁠OAuth redirect handler for both host and invitee flows
•⁠  ⁠Stores token in httpOnly cookie, redirects back to the originating screen

## Vision Prompt

Keep the system prompt in ⁠ /lib/prompts/parseReceipt.ts ⁠ as a named export.

The prompt must:
 1.⁠ ⁠Request JSON only (⁠ response_format: { type: "json_object" } ⁠)
 2.⁠ ⁠Specify the exact ⁠ Receipt ⁠ schema as JSON Schema inline
 3.⁠ ⁠Instruct the model to split bundled items into equal unit prices
 4.⁠ ⁠Return ⁠ null ⁠ for unreadable fields — no guessing

## UI Screens — Host

 1.⁠ ⁠*Capture* — camera button + file upload fallback. Show upload progress ring.
 2.⁠ ⁠*Review* — parsed line items. "Add People" button opens side panel.
   - Side panel shows top-5 bunq friends with avatars; "Add someone" option prompts for name + email
   - Selected people shown as avatar chips at the bottom
   - "Send Links" CTA activates when ≥1 person selected
 3.⁠ ⁠*Tracking* — live list of invitees with status chips (Pending / Paid / Skipped). Each paid card expands to show what they paid for and the amount. Polls ⁠ /api/session/[sessionId]/status ⁠ every 3 seconds.
 4.⁠ ⁠*Done* — when all invitees have paid or skipped. Shows total collected vs receipt total.

## UI Screens — Invitee (via link)

 1.⁠ ⁠*Receipt View* — full parsed receipt. Each item has a tap target.
   - Tap once → item highlighted in your colour (you're claiming it solo)
   - Tap again → "sharing" mode — enter how many people are sharing (or tap other sharers' names if that data is available)
   - Running "Your total" shown at bottom, updates live
 2.⁠ ⁠*Confirm & Pay* — summary of claimed items + total. bunq OAuth button. Shows host name so invitee knows who they're paying.
 3.⁠ ⁠*Nothing to pay* — "I had nothing" button skips to a thank-you screen with no payment.
 4.⁠ ⁠*Done* — payment confirmed. Shows bunq transaction reference.

## bunq Integration Notes

•⁠  ⁠Use *sandbox* environment during development (⁠ https://public-api.sandbox.bunq.com/v1/ ⁠)
•⁠  ⁠Swap to production only for the live demo
•⁠  ⁠*Host OAuth scopes:* ⁠ payment ⁠ (read), ⁠ user ⁠ (read) — to fetch friends and receive payment IBAN
•⁠  ⁠*Invitee OAuth scopes:* ⁠ payment ⁠ (write), ⁠ user ⁠ (read) — to execute the outbound payment
•⁠  ⁠Payment body requires: ⁠ amount ⁠, ⁠ currency ⁠, ⁠ description ⁠, ⁠ counterparty_alias ⁠ (host IBAN)
•⁠  ⁠bunq rate-limit: add 200ms delay between payment calls if firing many at once

Relevant docs: https://doc.bunq.com/ — see ⁠ payment ⁠, ⁠ oauth ⁠, and ⁠ monetary-account ⁠ sections.

---

## Email Invite

•⁠  ⁠Send via a transactional email provider (Resend or SendGrid — pick one, add API key to env)
•⁠  ⁠Subject: ⁠ {hostName} wants to split a receipt with you ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Body: one-line summary of merchant + total, CTA button linking to ⁠ /split/[sessionId]/[inviteeId] ⁠
•⁠  ⁠Keep template minimal — this is a hackathon

## Edge Cases to Handle Gracefully

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| Receipt has no line items (just a total) | Show single line "Total: €X" — invitee can claim it or skip |
| Total mismatch after extraction | Show warning banner; host can proceed anyway |
| Non-Latin receipt (Chinese, Arabic, etc.) | GPT-4o handles it — no special logic |
| Invitee not on bunq | Show their computed amount + "Copy amount" button; skip bunq OAuth |
| Two invitees both claim the same item solo | Server recomputes shares server-side at pay time using final ⁠ sharedWith ⁠ count |
| Invitee opens link after session expires (>24h) | Show "This link has expired" screen |
| Network error during payment | Retry once, then show error with amount to pay manually |
| Image too dark / blurry | Sharp helps; if parse fails, prompt retake |

---

## What to Skip (hackathon scope)

•⁠  ⁠Persistent storage beyond in-memory (no DB, no Redis)
•⁠  ⁠Receipt history or user accounts
•⁠  ⁠Expense categories / accounting export
•⁠  ⁠Multi-currency
•⁠  ⁠Native iOS/Android app
•⁠  ⁠Real-time WebSockets (polling is fine)
•⁠  ⁠Push notifications (email is enough)

## Demo Script (for judges)

 1.⁠ ⁠Open app on phone
 2.⁠ ⁠Photograph a real restaurant receipt on the table
 3.⁠ ⁠Show parsed line items populating in ~3 seconds
 4.⁠ ⁠Open side panel — tap Alice and Bob from top-5 friends, tap "Send Links"
 5.⁠ ⁠Switch to Alice's device (or a second browser tab with her link)
 6.⁠ ⁠Alice taps her pasta, shares the wine with everyone, taps "Confirm & Pay"
 7.⁠ ⁠Switch back to host — tracking screen shows Alice as Paid with her breakdown
 8.⁠ ⁠Bob does the same on his device
 9.⁠ ⁠Host Done screen shows full collection summary
10.⁠ ⁠Total time target: under 90 seconds from photo to both payments received

Cache the parse result client-side so re-demos don't re-call the API.
